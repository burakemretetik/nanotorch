## What is NanoTorch?
NanoTorch is a **minimal deep learning framework** built from scratch using **only essential Python libraries**:
- `numpy` – for fast array math  
- `matplotlib` – for plotting training curves  
- Standard library – `random`, `math`, etc.

**No PyTorch. No TensorFlow. No shortcuts.**
I'm planning to implement **everything by hand** to understand how neural networks really work:
- `Tensor` with automatic differentiation (autograd)
- Backpropagation engine
- Layers: `Linear`, `ReLU`, `Conv2d`, `MaxPool2d`
- Optimizers: `SGD`, `Adam`
- Mini-batch `DataLoader`
- Full training loop with loss & accuracy tracking

## Why Build This?
To **learn deep learning, not just use it**.
